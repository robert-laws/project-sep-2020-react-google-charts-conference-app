# Project - September 2020 - React & Google Charts Conference App

Basic Data Dashboard with React and Google Charts

**Technologies Employed**

- React
- Context API
- React Google Charts
- Materialize CSS
- Tabletop (to connect with external Google Sheets)

The website initializes the app by connecting to Google Sheet data sources and loading the data into context. The website then keeps the data into state and manipulates it through filters to change the views.

The front-end design is a combination of Materialize CSS and Google Charts. It includes responsive design for mobile device usage and desktop use.

The website demonstrates the power of using a tool such as React and Context API, which allows data to be loaded once and manipulated in multiple different ways - as demonstrated by the filtering features.
